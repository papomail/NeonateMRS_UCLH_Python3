# Supporting module: Spec_Module.py
The Spec_Module.py module is imported at the beginning of the main **MRS_convert.py** script and contains *classes* that are necessary for the execution of the code.

___
### **_ init _(self):** 
The **_ init _**  method in the SpecObject class initiates the core functionality of the NeonateMRS script.  

Through a series of steps described below, the *_ init _* method handles the identification and loading of the MRS DICOM data, computes the FFT, phase and frequency corrects each of the NMR frames before adding them together into the final spectrum that will be processed in Tarquin. 

The  phase and frequency shifts are automatically corrected based on the Cho and Chr resonances. (Note: As described above, the GUI provides the user control to adjust and override the automated corrections as well as to exclude from the summation any NMR frame that may be of lower quality than the average). 

Arguments for **_ init _(self, filename, dirpass)**:  
<pre> filename: name of the file to check for DICOM format data. 

dirpass: name of the folder containing filename.

The final action of **_ init _()** is to call the **complex_data()** method.  



___
### **complex_data(self)**:  
The method *complex_data()* forms the complex k-space (time domain) data and it's FFT complex spectra and arranges them in a series of **Frames**/2  arrays (Frames/2 because it only take the water suppressed data) with **Datapoints** complex points per frame from data stored in **SpecData** of the instance of type SpectObject.  

Once the data is arranged in the array, it applies an apodisation function (a mono-exponential decay to the 2nd half of the spectra) to generate to parallel sets of spectra; apodised and non-apodised.

The apodised spectra is used to improve the results of the auto phase and frequency shift algorithms. Only the corrected non-apodised spectra is fitted in Tarquin.

</pre>

### **writejmruidata2(self, outpath)**:  
The method **writejmruidata2()** compiles and saves the textfile required to process the corrected NMR data (*Kspacewrite*) in jMRUI. It writes the needed parameter values in a jMRUI-readable format and outputs the textfile to the directory specified by *outpath*. 

Arguments for **writejmruidata2(self, outpath)**:
<pre>
outpath: path of the directory where the output textfile will be saved.
</pre>
The textfile includes the following additional data to be interpreted by jMRUI:
<pre>
    Filename: file_path
    PointsInDataset: Datapoints
    DatasetsInFile: Frames/2
    SamplingInterval: SpectralWidth
    ZeroOrderPhase: 0E0
    BeginTime: 0E0
    TransmitterFrequency: TransmitterFrequency*1e6
    MagneticField: FieldStrength
    TypeOfNucleus: 0E0
    NameOfPatient: PatID
    DateOfExperiment: AcquisitionDateTime
    Spectrometer: Blank
    AdditionalInfo: ProtocolName           
</pre>           
*(Note: **writejmruidata2()** method works but the output file is unused; we use Tarquin)*         




___
### **writejmruidata2orig(self)**:  
Same as **writejmruidata2()** but it outputs the unprocessed summed data *Kspace* instead.  

*(Note: **writejmruidata2orig()** method works but the output file is unused; we use Tarquin)*  




___
### **writeTarquin(self, outpath)**:  
The function of <b>writeTarquin()</b> is to creates the DICOM file which will be used as the input for the spectroscopic analysis in Tarquin.    
The DICOM file is generated based on the original DICOM object stored in *ds* but where the original data has been replaced by it's corresponding, water-suppressed only, frequency and phase shifted data stored in <i>Kspacewrite</i> 
The new DICOM is saved to directory specified by <i>outpath</i>.

Arguments for **writeTarquin(self, outpath)**:
<pre>
outpath: path of the directory where the output DICOM will be saved.  
</pre>


___
### **writeTarquinorig(self, outpath)**:  
Same as **writeTarquinorig()** for the unprocessed *Kspace* data. The output of **writeTarquinorigfile()** is essentially the original DICOM file where the non-water suppressed date has been removed.

Arguments for **writeTarquinorig(self, outpath)**:
<pre>
outpath: path of the directory where the output DICOM will be saved.  
</pre>

*Note: **writeTarquinorig()** method is unused*   



___
### **writelogfile(self, outpath, version)**:  
**writelogfile()** compiles and saves a logfile with the values of the preprocessing corrections applied to each NMR frame for reproducibility and record-keeping purposes.   
It outputs the logfile to the directory specified by *outpath*. 

Arguments for **writelogfile(self, outpath, version)**:
<pre>
outpath: path of the directory where the output textfile will be saved.

version: version number of the script used.
</pre>          
The logfile stores the following information:
<pre>
Filename: file_path
Version: version       
For each frame:
    - Frame number.
    - Include: flag for included (1) or excluded (0) frame.
    - Phasing: final phase applied to the individual frame (stored in <i>optphasearr</i>)
    - Peak positions: final Cr and Cho peak positions per frame (stored in <i>peakposarr</i>)  
</pre>   



___
### **fitTarquin(self, outpath):**  
The purpose of **fitTarquin()** is three-fold. 1) It sets the appropriate parameters (inputs, outputs, basis, etc) for Tarquin to run the spectroscopy fitting, 2) it then reads the output from Tarquin and calculates the values of the metabolite ratios that will be included in the final report, and 3) formats the layout of the report with the required information and calls <b>PDF()</b> to produce the final PDF document.   

Arguments for **fitTarquin(self, outpath)**:
<pre>
outpath: path of the directory where the new Tarquin_files folder will be created where the outputs from Tarquin and the subsecuently genarated PDF report will be saved.
</pre>
1)  Input paramenters for Tarquin:  
<pre>
--input: DICOM file generated by writeTarquin()

--output_pdf: filename of the PDF generated by Tarquin with the plot of fitted NMR peaks ('_plot.pdf')

--output_csv: filename of the CSV file generated by Tarquin with the signal amplitude of the fitted peaks ('_data.csv')

--output_fit: filename of the CSV file generated by Tarquin with the fit values             (Unused)

--basis_csv: path to the basis set to be used for the Tarquin analysis. Currently 3_0T_basis_threonine_no_MM

</pre>
2)  Paramenters involved in the generation of metabolite ratios:       
<pre>
dataout: Tarquin CSV file output with the signal amplitudes (saved by Tarquin as '_data.csv')

resout: log file with the calculated ratio of the metabolites (file saved as '_results.csv')

moddataout: same as the dataout CSV file with additional fields including the metabolite ratios (file saved as '_data_with_ratios.csv')  

</pre>
3)  Paramenters linked to the final PDF report creation:   
<pre>
tempout: first part of the PDF report gerated by the <b>output()</b> method of the <b>PDF()</b> class. Contains the desired metabolite ratios as well as other relevant information, ie acquisition TE, patient ID, etc. (Requires FPDF module for class PDF() )

pdfout: second part of the report which includes the plot generated by Tarquin; same as output_pdf ('_plot.pdf')

reportout: final MRS report combining tempout and pdfout in a single document.  (Requires PyPDF2 module to combine both files)   

</pre>

> ## Class PDF(FPDF):   

Class PDF defines and creates the PDF files based on FPDF class' functionality. 
It defines the *header* and the *footer* of the final PDF report using the corresponding methods. Both **header()** and **footer()** methods already exist in the FPDF class but do nothing by default, therefore we have to extend the class and override them.


## Methods in PDF(self) class:
___
### **header(self):**
Defines the page header of the final MRS report: includes department information  and the official *UCLH header* logo.

___
### **footer(self):**
Defines the page footer of the final MRS report: type of document ('Neonatal MRS Report'), report date, version of Tarquin used and the official *UCLH footer* logo.   


 



#
##  Class PatNameDialog(QtGui.QDialog):
Built on *QtGui*, the **PatNameDialog()** class creates a dialog window in which the user can check, and ammend if necessary,  the report identification number (the default identification number is defined as the Patient ID stored in the DICOM header).  
When overwritten, the report will include the text entered by the user as the report ID. This is useful in order to generate alternative reports (e.g. produced by different users).


#
#      
>## The main() method
#### **main():** executes the QtGui.QApplication and invokes the Maingui() method to initiate the script.
